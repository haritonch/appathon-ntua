# appathon-ntua

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a front-end app that makes requests to the [Met Museum API](https://metmuseum.github.io/) and display paintings and information about them. The final project will look like Instagram's explore page, but filled with paintings. When the user clicks on a painting, requests are made to bring more relevant artwork (same period, same artist, same collection, etc.)

## Implementation
The implementation will be done using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), Javascript (React)
